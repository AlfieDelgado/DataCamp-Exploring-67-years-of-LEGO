# DataCamp-Exploring-67-years-of-LEGO
In this project we will explore a database of every LEGO set ever built. The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data
